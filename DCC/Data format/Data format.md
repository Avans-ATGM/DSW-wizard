## Data format

* Clearly note what format(s) your data will be in, e.g., plain text (.txt), comma-separated values (.csv), geo-referenced TIFF (.tif, .tfw).
* Explain why you have chosen certain formats. Decisions may be based on staff expertise, a preference for open formats, the standards accepted by data centres or widespread usage within a given community.
* Using standardised, interchangeable or open formats ensures the long-term usability of data; these are recommended for sharing and archiving.
* See UK Data Service guidance on *[recommended formats](https://www.ukdataservice.ac.uk/manage-data/format/recommended-formats)* or DataONE Best Practices for *[file formats](https://www.dataone.org/best-practices/document-and-store-data-using-stable-file-formats)*.
