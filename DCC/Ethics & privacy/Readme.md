## Ethics & privacy

* Investigators carrying out research involving human participants should request consent to preserve and share the data. Do not just ask for permission to use the data in your study or make unnecessary promises to delete it at the end.
* Consider how you will protect the identity of participants, e.g., via anonymisation or using managed access procedures.
* Ethical issues may affect how you store and transfer data, who can see/use it and how long it is kept. You should demonstrate that you are aware of this and have planned accordingly.
* See UK Data Service guidance on *[consent for data sharing](https://ukdataservice.ac.uk/manage-data/legal-ethical/consent-data-sharing)*.
* See *[ICPSR approach to confidentiality](http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/content/datamanagement/confidentiality/index.html)* and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act *[(HIPAA) regulations for health research](https://privacyruleandresearch.nih.gov/)* .
