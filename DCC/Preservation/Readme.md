## Preservation

* Outline the plans for data sharing and preservation - how long will the data be retained and where will it be archived? Will additional resources be needed to prepare data for deposit or meet any charges from data repositories?
* See the DCC guide: *[How to appraise and select research data for curation](http://www.dcc.ac.uk/resources/how-guides/appraise-select-data)* or *[DataONE Best Practices: Identifying data with long-term value](https://www.dataone.org/best-practices/identify-data-long-term-value)*.
