## Storage & Security

* Describe where the data will be stored and backed up during the course of research activities. This may vary if you are doing fieldwork or working across multiple sites so explain each procedure.
* Identify who will be responsible for backup and how often this will be performed. The use of robust, managed storage with automatic backup, for example, that provided by university IT teams, is preferable. Storing data on laptops, computer hard drives or external storage devices alone is very risky.
* See UK Data Service Guidance on *[data storage](https://www.ukdataservice.ac.uk/manage-data/store)* or DataONE Best Practices for *[storage](https://www.dataone.org/best-practices/storage)*.
* Also consider data security, particularly if your data is sensitive e.g., detailed personal data, politically sensitive information or trade secrets. Note the main risks and how these will be managed. Also note whether any institutional data security policies are in place.
* Identify any formal standards that you will comply with, e.g., ISO 27001. See the DCC Briefing Paper on Information Security Management - *[ISO 27000](http://www.dcc.ac.uk/resources/briefing-papers/standards-watch-papers/information-security-management-iso-27000-iso-27k-s)* and UK Data Service guidance on data *[security](https://www.ukdataservice.ac.uk/manage-data/store/security)*.
