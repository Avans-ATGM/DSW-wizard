## Data volume

* Note what volume of data you will create in MB/GB/TB. Indicate the proportions of raw data, processed data, and other secondary outputs (e.g., reports).
* Consider the implications of data volumes in terms of storage, access and preservation. Do you need to include additional costs?
* Consider whether the scale of the data will pose challenges when sharing or transferring data between sites; if so, how will you address these challenges?
