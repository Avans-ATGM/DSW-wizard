## Data sharing

* How will you share the data e.g. deposit in a data repository, use a secure data service, handle data requests directly or use another mechanism? The methods used will depend on a number of factors such as the type, size, complexity and sensitivity of the data.
* When will you make the data available? Research funders expect timely release. They typically allow embargoes but not prolonged exclusive use.
* Who will be able to use your data? If you need to restrict access to certain communities or apply data sharing agreements, explain why.
* Consider strategies to minimise restrictions on sharing. These may include anonymising or aggregating data, gaining participant consent for data sharing, gaining copyright permissions, and agreeing a limited embargo period.
* How might your data be reused in other contexts? Where there is potential for reuse, you should use standards and formats that facilitate this, and ensure that appropriate metadata is available online so your data can be discovered. Persistent identifiers should be applied so people can reliably and efficiently find your data. They also help you to track citations and reuse.
