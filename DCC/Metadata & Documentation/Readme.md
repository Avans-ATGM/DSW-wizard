## Metadata & Documentation

* What metadata will be provided to help others identify and discover the data?
* Researchers are strongly encouraged to use community metadata standards where these are in place. The Research Data Alliance offers a *[Directory of Metadata Standards](http://rd-alliance.github.io/metadata-directory/)*. Data repositories may also provide guidance about appropriate metadata standards.
* Consider what other documentation is needed to enable reuse. This may include information on the methodology used to collect the data, analytical and procedural information, definitions of variables, units of measurement, any assumptions made, the format and file type of the data and software used to collect and/or process the data.
* Consider how you will capture this information and where it will be recorded, e.g., in a database with links to each item, in a ‘readme’ text file, in file headers, etc.
