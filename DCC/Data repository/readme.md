## Data repository

* Where will the data be deposited? If you do not propose to use an established repository, the data management plan should demonstrate that the data can be curated effectively beyond the lifetime of the grant.
* It helps to show that you have consulted with the repository to understand their policies and procedures, including any metadata standards, and costs involved.
* An international list of data repositories is available via *[re3data](http://www.re3data.org/)* and some universities or publishers provide lists of recommendations e.g., *[PLOS ONE recommended repositories](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/data-availability#loc-recommended-repositories)*.
